# Product Management App
This is a simple console based product management application that allows you to manage and search for products based on different criteria. The application has been designed to be beginner-friendly, so even if you have limited programming experience, you can easily understand and use it.


## Features
The product management app provides the following features:
- **Search Products by Place:** You can search for products based on their location. To do this, the app uses the Stream API and filters the products based on the specified place. The search is case-insensitive, so it will find products regardless of the letter casing.

- **Search Out of Warranty Products:** The app allows you to find products that are out of warranty. It uses the Stream API to filter the products based on the current year (assumed to be 2023). Any products with a warranty year earlier than 2023 are considered out of warranty.
